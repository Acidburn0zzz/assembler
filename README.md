# About language
The instruction set is forked from arm instruction set, but it is abbrivated a some.
It only has 17 instructions, and, as in arm condition language, every instruction appeal must be accompanied by
a condition for its executing.

# Syntax
The common syntax is:
[condition] [instruction] [arg0] [arg1] [arg2].
For giving argument as a register write 'r' after the number of it, for giving ram write '$' or '@' or 'm' and 
for giving a number, place there '#'.
